      <p>The history of Greece can be traced back to Stone Age hunters. Later came early farmers and the Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations. This was followed by a period of wars and invasions, known as the Middle Ages. Around 1100 BC, the people of the Dorians invaded from the north and spread along the west coast. In the period 500-336 BC, Greece was divided into small city-states, each of which consisted of a city with the surrounding countryside.</p>
      <p>The ancient Greek classical and Hellenistic eras are without doubt the most beautiful times, having left behind a myriad of ideas, concepts and the basics of what we now call "Western civilization". However, the previous two millennia leading to these ancient times, as well as the following two millennia, are all part of the history of Greece after leaving an equally rich cultural imprint on the territory. Much of the Greek civilization has survived either directly or through changes to the present day.</p>
      <p>The dialects of ancient Greece have greatly influenced both the modern Greek language and the vocabularies of other languages ​​spoken in the world today. The art and architecture of ancient Greece have proved highly influential in our time for the inner western society. The much-celebrated Renaissance was driven in large part by the rediscovery of ancient Greek ideas through texts and works of art, which until then had been repressed from the recognition of the authority of the church and the supernatural power.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that history is a discipline that has been conceived for the first time in ancient Greece. Herodotus (484-425 BC) is considered the "Father of History" and was the first to record the events and human actions for the sole purpose of handing down to future generations. Not much later than Herodotus, Thucydides (460-395 BC) in his History of the Peloponnesian War, he enrolled his name in the discipline of history, in an attempt to present the story in an "objective", creating links between human actions and events. Their approach and method for recording the historical events would become the guiding light for historians of the following two thousand years.</p>
