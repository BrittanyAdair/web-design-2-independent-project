      <p class="description">Considered the symbol of Athens and Greece, and indeed of Western civilization, the Acropolis is a rocky mound rising in the heart of modern Athens, crowned by three magnificent temples dating from the 5th century BC. The best known and most distinctive is the Parthenon, originally made up of 58 columns supporting a roof and decorated by ornate pediments and a frieze.</p>

      <p class="description">One of the most influential buildings in Greek history, the Parthenon, stands on top of the citadel of the Acropolis. It was dedicated to the goddess of wisdom and patron of the Athenians, Athena. The Parthenon was initially built as a celebration and thanks to the gods for the Hellenic victory over the Persians, but it also stands as an enduring symbol of Athenian democracy, ancient Greece, and Western civilization. It has served many roles over time, from a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in the final decade of the sixth century to a mosque after the Ottoman conquest in the early 1460s.</p>

      <p class="description">In the heyday of Delphi, the Temple of Apollo was the most prominent structure ever built, and its ruins date back to the fourth century BC. It was an imposing structure of the Doric order and it underwent many turbulent incarnations before falling into ruin. The Temple of Apollo at Delphi was first built by two prominent architects Trophonios and Agamedes during the seventh century BC. It caught on fire during the sixth century after which it was rebuilt and given the name of the Temple of Alcmeonidae in honor of the noble Athenian family who took on its reconstruction with funds donated from all over Greece. The temple had six columns in the front and 15 at the sides.Unfortunately, this temple was again destroyed in 373 BC by an earthquake and in 330 BC was rebuilt for the third time.</p>

    <div class="santorini">

      <p class="description">Stunning Santorini is the most dramatic of all the Greek isles. It is best known for the west coast cliff-top towns of Fira and Oia, which appear to hang over a deep, blue sea-filled caldera. Made up of typical Cycladic whitewashed cubic buildings, many of which have been converted into boutique hotels with infinity pools, both Fira and Oia are considered romantic destinations, popular for weddings and honeymoons.Things to do in Santorini include sunbathing and swimming at the black volcanic-sand beaches on the south and east coasts and visiting the archaeological site of Akrotiri, an Ancient Minoan settlement buried below lava following the volcanic eruption that created the caldera, some 3,600 years ago. The island has an airport and is served by ferries and catamarans from Athens' port, Piraeus.</p>
